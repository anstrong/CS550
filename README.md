# CS550
This repository is meant to act as a 'storage bin' for the projects I have worked on and completed in CS550. Whether or not it's conventional to do so (which it doesn't appear to be), I have the final code for each project on the main page as well as a branch for each project to keep their code and resources separate. I guess I could have made folders... but that's boring!

## Projects
### War
Not the most exciting program or game for the user, but it was a fun first Python project and a solid way to get comfortable with functions.

### Mandelbrot
Basically just a program that generates the Mandelbrot set with a simple UI to customize the zoom and color of the result.

### Flappy Bird
My favorite; my last project of the fall term that is meant to replicate the popular iOS game and keep me entertained.
