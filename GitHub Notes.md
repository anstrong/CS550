# GitHub Notes

*I know I was supposed to make a winter-specific repo, but I wanted to combine all of my CS projects into one place for easy access. Sorry!*

## Repositories
A repository is a folder of sorts for code. It is usually used to store code and resources for a specific project, and can be collaborated on by multiple 
users. It also contains records of all code changes and interactions, including **branches**, **pull requests**, notes on bugs, and more.

### Forks
A **fork** is more or less a copy of a repository and its contents. Any changes made in a forked repo will not affect the original project, making forking
an excellent way to put your own twist on someone else's project that you like and want to experiment with. However, the fork can be merged with the original
repository through a **pull request** if the owner of the project thinks your edits are worth adopting. In this way, forks are also great for bug squashing.

### Branches
Each repo can contain multiple 'branches' - versions of the code in the main part of the 'folder' that can be changed without changing the main version.
This main version is kept in the 'master' branch and can be added to through **pull requestss** made by users who wish to combine their branched code with the main version.
Editing the code on any branch- including the master- is done through **commits**, which are essentially 'saves' of the edits being made by the user. Each change to the code through
commits is recorded as version history, allowing the file to be restored to an earlier version if necessary.

### Pull requests
A **pull request** is simply a request to merge a **fork** or **branch** into the main project or master branch. These requests are usually intiated after the 
spin-off code has been finished and checked and is considered ready (and stable enough) to be added to the official version. After a request is made,
the project owner and the initiator of the request can review the changes together and merge them in either automatically (when there are no conflicts) or manually
once any necessary changes have been agreed upon and executed.
